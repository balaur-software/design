 * sight, gated by an IntersectionObserver instead of firing on load.
 *
 * SSR emits the content in its final, visible-but-untransitioned state so there
 * is no hydration mismatch; the reveal replays imperatively once
 * {@link useOnVisible} latches. Honours reduced-motion (content shows at once).

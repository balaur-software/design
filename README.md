# balaur-design

> **The OCTANT design system** — pure encoder, design tokens, and atomic React

> so the design system and the life OS can evolve independently.

A Bun-workspace monorepo with three packages:

| Package | What |
|---|---|
| `packages/octant-core` (`@balaur/octant-core`) | Pure, framework-agnostic encoder for OCTANT — the pixel→mask→Unicode-octant-glyph core (`octChar`) + canvas rasterization fallback. Zero deps, zero DOM. |
| `packages/tokens` (`@balaur/tokens`) | OCTANT design tokens (ANSI 16-color palette, ramps, type scale, motion, accent system) as typed TS + `tokens.css`; self-hosted DepartureMono. |
| `packages/ui` (`@balaur/ui`) | The OCTANT design system as atomic React components + Storybook. Depends on `@balaur/octant-core` and `@balaur/tokens`. |

## Using it (Bun — by design)

The package ships raw TypeScript — Bun consumes it natively; there is no
build step and no Node entry, deliberately. It is published as a **single
package**, `@balaur/octant`, from the repo root: the tarball carries a fixed
`files` list (each package's `src/`, no stories or tests) and exposes the
three layers via subpath `exports` (`.` = UI, `./tokens`, `./core`).

```bash
# in balaur-design/
bun install                            # resolve the workspace
bun run check                          # typecheck + lint + test
bun run storybook                      # component workshop on :6006
```

```jsonc
// host package.json — committed state pins a release tag
"dependencies": {
  "@balaur/octant": "github:balaur-software/design#vX.Y.Z"
}

// host package.json — active design iteration against a local checkout
"@balaur/octant": "file:../design"    // re-run `bun install` after edits
```

Do **not** `bun link` the packages (individually or as `@balaur/octant`) —
linking resolves `react` inside this repo's own module graph and produces two
React instances in the host, crashing hooks with `resolveDispatcher() is null`.
`file:../design` is the safe dev override. See
[docs/CONSUMING.md](docs/CONSUMING.md) for the full consumption guide and
[docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) for the tag-and-release runbook.

## Scripts

```bash
bun install          # resolve the workspace
bun run storybook    # component workshop (packages/ui) on :6006
bun test             # run all workspace tests
bun run check        # fast gate: typecheck + lint + bun test (~5s)
bun run check:full   # fast gate + Storybook interaction tests in headless Chromium
bun run test-vrt     # visual regression suite; baselines under packages/ui/src/__vrt__; regenerate with `bunx vitest run --project=vrt -u` after intentional visual changes
```

The browser suite requires a Playwright Chromium (`bunx playwright install chromium`, one-time) and takes 1–2 minutes.

Requires Bun ≥ 1.2.

## Lint policy (deliberate demotions)

`bun run check` currently passes with zero lint errors and zero warnings.
Four rules are deliberately disabled in `biome.json` rather than enforced:

- `style/noNonNullAssertion` — `!` is used judiciously under
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, where the compiler already forces index checks.
- `suspicious/noArrayIndexKey`, `correctness/useExhaustiveDependencies` —
  common false positives in Storybook stories and animation hooks.
- `a11y/useSemanticElements` — OCTANT's terminal aesthetic renders
  role-annotated `div`/`pre` structures by design; `a11y/useValidAriaRole`
  stays on (configured with `ignoreNonDom`).

Re-enabling any of these is a separate, intentional change, not a side effect
of other work.

## License

TBD — same license as the host life OS, to be ratified in the first
non-extraction commit.
